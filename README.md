# Emission Factor Database for Humanitarian Action
This repository hosts the database of emission factors curated as a combination of the data provided in the [Humanitarian Carbon Calculator]() and the new emission factors created as part of the CAA project: [*Accelerating the reduction of the environmental impact of humanitarian action*](https://climateactionaccelerator.org/accelerating-the-reduction-of-the-environmental-impact-of-humanitarian-action/) completed in June 2025. 

The International Committee of the Red Cross, the Climate Action Accelerator and two departments of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the EssentialTech Centre and the Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics teamed up to conduct and openly share the Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of some of the most sourced items in the humanitarian sector. The new emission factors are derived from LCAs conducted as part of this project, the in-depth documentation of which can be found [at this link](https://climateactionaccelerator.org/repository-of-lifecycle-assessments/) on the CAA website.
